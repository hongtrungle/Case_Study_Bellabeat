# 1. Usage Time 

![powerbi_usagetime_chart](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95112831/216493058-52fc97ec-f964-4d3d-8a8f-41415e221801.PNG)

- Users use device on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday higher than the other days. They may use it more often in the 
middle of the week when they have to work.
- There are no significant differences between average hour using per day in week. The number is 
- highest on Monday 
(20.95 hours) and lowest on Thursday (19.65 hours).
- When it comes to average hour using per day, there seems to be a clear divide between 2 clusters of users. Those who 
use nearly for the whole day (> 20 hours - account for 54.55%) and those who use for parts of the day (< 20 hours - 
account for 45.45%). My hypothesis is that the divergence is caused by users taking off the device when they sleep.

# 2. Calories Consumption

- Steps, Distance and Intensity are positively correlated to calories consumption.

# 3. Steps and Distance

![powerbi_stepsanddistance_chart](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95112831/216281264-9c01da3e-517e-40f6-a068-fbca5f5975c7.PNG)

- 6 users having the average steps of 7000-8000 is the highest number of users in each group of 1000 steps
- Only 7 out of 33 users (21.21%) have the average steps over 10000 a day (10000 steps a day is recommended by health
organisations)
- 6 users having the average distance of 5-6km and 6-7km is the highest number of users in each group of 1km
- Only 5 out of 33 users (15.15%) have the average distance over 8km a day (8km a day is recommended by health 
organization)

# 4. Intensity

![powerbi_intensity_chart](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95112831/216493077-f9a68f90-ea92-458b-82a0-3a5124ee308c.PNG)

- Intensity over time 
  - The highest intensity in a day happens from 6 to 8pm. Afterwards, the intensity decreases gradually until 
reaching its minimum at 3am. 
  - In the morning, the intensity gradually increases until 12am. 
  - In the afternoon, the intensity decreases slightly until 3pm before increasing again and peaking at 7pm.
- Intensity per day in week 
  - The day with the highest intensity is Saturday, followed by Tuesday and Monday, while Sunday has the lowest intensity. 
  I hypothesize that users want to spend Saturday doing more activities and Sunday to rest.
- Looking at the heatmap, we can say:
  - Saturday has the longest streak of high intensity (from 9am to 3pm).
  - Days in the middle of the week usually have high intensity from 4pm to 7pm. 
  - On Sunday, intensity tend to be kept stable from 10am to 7pm.

# 5. Sleep Data

![powerbi_sleepdata_chart](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95112831/216493089-016512e8-2c20-4f0f-8609-5037a932c888.PNG)

- Users spend average 419.17 minutes (around 7 hours) being asleep. That's also the time recommended by health 
organizations. 
- It comes as no surprise that Sunday is the day users sleep the most. On the other hand, Thursday, Tuesday and Friday 
are the top 3 from the bottom.
- It takes up to average 39.31 minutes for users to sleep. This number is much higher than 15-20 minutes, which is the
recommended time to sleep by health organizations.
- On Sunday, users have significantly higher time to sleep than other days (50.76 minutes).
- User' minutes of sleeping are positively correlated to user' total time in bed.

# 6. Recommendation

Here is my recommendations on how Bellabeat can take advantage of the existing trends to give customers a better service:
- Collect more data: Nearly half of users (45.45%) only track their data parts of the day. Therefore, it leads to losing
out important and valuable data. Bellabeat should encourage users to purchase their elegant designed "Leaf" series so 
that they can track their sleeping data comfortably. This can be done by providing discounts for additional items or 
rewarding users with high tracking time.
- Customized workout recommendations: As we know, steps, distance and intensity are 3 factors affecting consuming calories. 
From the amount of calories customers want to consume, we can build a exercise program customized for them.
- Improving number of steps and distance: Most users has fewer steps and distance in a day than recommended. Therefore, 
the app should make statistic of these metrics and give users advice to improve them. Bellabeat can also build a 
marketing strategy such as a competition to stimulate users to increase number of steps and distance. 
- Improving sleep: The problem with sleeping is that users take too long time to sleep. The app should have a warning
about this for users. Apart from this, Bellabeat can support users solutions to sleep faster.
- Partnering with doctors, nutritionists, and fitness centers to provide tips and programs to help improve users' health
